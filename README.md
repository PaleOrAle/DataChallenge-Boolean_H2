This repository is dedicated to the Data Challenge from Boolean and Human Highways (H2).

The goal of the challenge is to realize a scalable data visualization funnel in a creative and innovative way, bringing up some interesting and unexpected insights, either only with the datasets provided or better with the help of further data from other sources that may be relevant and linked with the original datasets.

Two official datasets are provided:
- `dataset_profilo_intervistati.xlsx`, containing the personal information from all the H2 research panel subscribers.
- `dataset_indagine_stati_animo.xlsx`, containing the answers to the "Stati d'animo" survey from a pool of around 8200 subscribers to the research panel originated from 9 waves of monthly surveys.

The "Stati d'animo" survey poses questions about how they feel regarding some personal, community, national and international issues.
The surveys started in february 2023 and are repeated on a monthly-ish basis.
